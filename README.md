# Note-Taker2

## Description of Project
To allow business owners to write and save notes to help them organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.

## Aims/Goals
1. When I open the Note Taker I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
2. When I click on the link to the notes page I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields in the center of the window to enter a new note title and the note’s text. (I suppose technically it's in the right-hand column.)
3. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text a Save icon (i.e. floppy disk) appears in the righthand  navigation at the top of the page.
4. When I click on the Save icon the new note I entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
5. When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column.
6. When I click on the Write icon (+) in the navigation at the top of the page I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.

In this image, the note has been created and is residing in the lefthand column. Now we delete it.

Hopefully this shows how the note was first created, then deleted from the command line.
