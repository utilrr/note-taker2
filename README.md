# Note-Taker2

## Description of Project
To allow business owners to write and save notes to help them organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.

## Aims/Goals
1. When I open the Note Taker I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
2. When I click on the link to the notes page I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
3. When I enter a new note title and the note’s text a Save icon (floppy disk?) appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
4. When I click on the Save icon the new note I entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
5. When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column.
6. When I click on the Write icon (+) in the navigation at the top of the page I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
